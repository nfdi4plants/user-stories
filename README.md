# user-stories
user stories for tools in the DataPLANT stack via github issues

See the stories here: https://github.com/nfdi4plants/user-stories/issues

## format

user stories follow a simple format (see for example https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories):

```
“As a <persona>, I <want to>, <so that>.”
```

- "As a [persona]": Who are we building this for? We’re not just after a job title, we’re after the persona of the person. Max. Our team should have a shared understanding of who Max is. We’ve hopefully interviewed plenty of Max’s. We understand how that person works, how they think and what they feel. We have empathy for Max.
- “Wants to”: Here we’re describing their intent — not the features they use. What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free — if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point.
- “So that”: how does their immediate desire to do something this fit into their bigger picture? What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?

Ideally, these stories are created by DataPLANT members after talking to users, so users do not have to come here to create stories
